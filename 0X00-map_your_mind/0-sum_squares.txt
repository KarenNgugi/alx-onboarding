1. obtain input number "n"
2. declare variable "sum_of_squares" and set it to 0
3. start loop at 1
4. multiply current loop number by itself and add to "sum_of_squares"
5. increment current loop number by 1
6. check if current loop number is greater than "n"
6.a. if current loop number is not greater than "n", repeat steps 4-6
6.b. if current loop number is greater than "n", exit loop
7. print "sum_of_squares"
